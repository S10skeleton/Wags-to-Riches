## How To Use
This application runs a few add ons, so an "npm i" is necessary. The api used needs a new token generated every now and then, so if the webpage is not showing, you will need to run a curl and replace in the .env file. Here is the command for the curl: <br>
curl -d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=NP4rJsSc3VrVGgqE9140GJVeyYyWxiCE5FZQ9dWadtxHb43E8o&client_secret=FY6HbbruBHe4qv5FIwHSSw6dRajEABaPWZXk439O" https://api.petfinder.com/v2/oauth2/token
